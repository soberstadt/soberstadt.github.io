A few months ago, I came up with an idea for an Android app. This app would be a way to keep daily accountability easy and available for everyone. The general concept is that a user would add n number of questions (ex: Have you been completely honest with your significant other since last answering these questions? or Have you spent in the Word since last answering these questions?) and add n number of partners who could then get daily or weekly updates on the userâ€™s responses.

After letting this idea slowly develop in my head, I finally started to set a goal to do it. Here are the facts:

  * I have little, to no, experience developing for the Android platform
  * I do however have experience with Java
  * I want to have the project in v1 Beta on the market by Oct. 13.

Stay posted for updates of the project.
