Check it, its day 3 for project. And I wanted to describe the loose project timeline moving forward. As I posted in the previous blog that I wanted to have v1Beta on the market by Oct. 13th, v1Beta will hopefully support Android 2.1 and email follow-ups. After that, I would really like to move to SMS support. Future plans for SMS are very much up the air, but hopefully, users will be able to answer accountability questions and receive partner updates both via SMS. Long term, iOS and Blackberry will be supported naively. The Flex for AIR is a great framework is great, but I simply do not find it dependable enough to support a long lasting app and support is spotty at best.
