![][1]For starters, yes, I am a Google fan-boy. However, if you don’t use Chrome, I’m sure that most of these are available for Firefox. If you used Safari or Internet Explorer, its time to move on. [Chrome][2] lets your sync extensions across different computers, which changes the game massively.

There are a lot of great extensions out there, but today I was realizing that I love some of the extensions I have and I hope that anyone who reads this will also love them.

In somewhat order of highest recommended first.

### [LastPass][3] - Password Vault

I know its scary giving out your passwords to some service on the net. However, LastPass is more then a little guy who helps you remember your passwords. It fills logins(and even automatically logs in if you want) and forms. I use this extension multiple times a day, especially for my campus sites that can sometimes have me enter my full email and 15  character password multiple times. LassPass makes this go away by simply entering them for me.

### [SpeedDial2][4] – Homepage Replacement

An amazingly simple home screen that lets you add tiles and have all of your favorite sites at a single click away. Many customizable settings.

### [Instachrome][5] & [Readability][6] - Reader Assistants

These two make a powerful combination. Instachrome lets you make things to be “Read Later” on your [Instapaper ][7]account. Which is great for when your stumble upon an article or something that is interesting, but you want to read later, just hit Alt Shift S and it will add it to the list for you to go back to at your leisure. Once you get around to actually reading the article, sometimes the site’s glitz  and glamour can be distracting. I find that even on sites like [Android Developer][8] it can be hard to read. Readability fixes that and helps your see your content in a comfortable, customizable way.

### [Google Voice][9] – Texting and Calling from In Browser

If you have a Google Voice number this is a must have! If you don’t have a Google Voice you should [check it out][10]. It notifies you of new incoming messages, allows me to respond right from my browser along with composing new and making calls.

### [TweetDeck][11] – Twitter Facebook = Sweet

If you use social networking sites and haven’t tried a 3rd party client, I would check this out to. Puts your twitter and facebook in one feed for updates. Pretty cool.

### (Pandora Users) [Anesidora ][12]& [PandoraEnhancer][13]

Anesidora: Allows you to not have a new tab for Pandora. Very slick.
PandoraEnhancer: Adds a bunch of different options like ad removal(which I discourage) and song change notifications.

### (Android Users) [Chrome to Phone][14] – Phone connection

Lets you send links from browser to your phone. Simple, but useful on the go.

### (Web Developers) [Stylebot][15] – CSS Modifier

This handy extension allows you to change css of the current site. Great for testing, or if you have to do some CSS hacks on someone else’s page for some reason.
