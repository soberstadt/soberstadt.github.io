Well I’m still pushing updates for the 2 of us using the app. It’s been fun managing an app like this.

## Change Log

#### NEW:

  * Short Answer Questions. Add or edit a question and change question type to short answer.
  * Follow-up request check box in when reporting which will include a request for a follow
up in your report. This can be hidden in the settings.
  * Auto-sync Questions. You will notice now every 10 times you open the reporting activity,
it will sync your questions. You may find anomalies in your questions, please go to
your questions list to fix them.

#### FIX:

  * Fixed successful report notification.
